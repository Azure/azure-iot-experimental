/**------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Simple example of the Chirp Connect C SDK on the Microsoft MXChip IoT DevKit.
 *
 *  @file chirp-connect-armv7m-cm4.ino
 * 
 *  @brief After having created an account on https://developers.chirp.io, get 
 *  your Key, Secret and Config string from your account using the Microsoft-MXChip
 *  protocol and set them a few lines below in this file.
 * 
 *  This example will start in listening mode. The listening and playing modes
 *  can alternate by pressing the button A (left one).
 * 
 *  Each time the SDK will start receiving some data the LED will turn blue.
 *  If the data has been sucessfully decoded then the LED will turn green and the
 *  hexadecimal representation of the data as well as the length of the message,
 *  in bytes, will be displayed. If the decode failed the LED will turn red.
 * 
 *  In playing mode, each push on the button B (right one) will start sending a
 *  random payload of random lenght and turn the LED yellow. Once the payload
 *  has been sent the LED wil turn cyan and the hexadecimal representation of the
 *  data sent as well as the length of the payload, in bytes, will be displayed.
 *  The audio data is sent by the 3.5 mm jack output.
 * 
 *  Known issues :
 *  - For some reason, at 16kHz, recording again after having played almost always
 *    fails. The quick and easy solution is to restart the program by presing the
 *    reset button.
